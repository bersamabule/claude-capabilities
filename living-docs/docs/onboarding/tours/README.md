# Code Tours

Code tours provide guided walkthroughs of specific areas of the codebase.

## Creating a Tour

Run `/tour:create [area]` to generate a tour for a specific area like:
- `/tour:create auth` - Authentication flow
- `/tour:create api` - API routes and endpoints
- `/tour:create data` - Database and data layer
- `/tour:create ui` - UI components

## Tour Structure

Each tour is a markdown file with:
1. Overview and prerequisites
2. 5-10 "stops" at key files
3. Explanations and key points at each stop
4. Summary and next steps

## Available Tours
