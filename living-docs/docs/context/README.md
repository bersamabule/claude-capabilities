# Context Guardian - Working State Directory

This directory stores session handoff files generated by the Context Guardian capability.

## Files

| File | Purpose | Generated By |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `WORKING.md` | Full session state for planned handoffs | `/context-guardian` |
| `EMERGENCY.md` | Minimal state for emergency handoffs | `/emergency-handoff` |

## How It Works

When Claude Code sessions approach context limits, the Context Guardian creates handoff files that capture the current working state. This allows new sessions to resume exactly where the previous one left off.

## Usage

### Check Context Status
```
/context-status
```
Shows current context usage and recommendations.

### Proactive Handoff (70-80% context)
```
/context-guardian
```
Creates comprehensive `WORKING.md` with full state.

### Emergency Handoff (90%+ context)
```
/emergency-handoff
```
Creates minimal `EMERGENCY.md` to preserve critical work.

## Context Usage Guidelines

| Usage | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 0-50% | Green | Continue normally |
| 50-70% | Yellow | Be mindful, consider handoff soon |
| 70-80% | Orange | Run `/context-guardian` now |
| 80-90% | Red | Emergency - run `/emergency-handoff` |
| 90%+ | Critical | Session at imminent risk |

## Resuming Work

In a new session, reference handoff files:

```
Continue from the previous session. Read docs/context/WORKING.md
for the full state. [Add specific context if needed]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Check regularly**: Run `/context-status` every 30-40 messages
2. **Handoff early**: At 70-80%, not when forced
3. **Use subagents**: Offload exploration to preserve main context
4. **Keep CLAUDE.md lean**: Under 5k tokens
5. **Clear between tasks**: Use `/clear` for unrelated work
