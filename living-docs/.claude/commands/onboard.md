# Intelligent Onboarding Agent - Codebase Onboarding

Generate a comprehensive onboarding guide for this codebase.

## Usage

`/onboard` - Full onboarding guide
`/onboard:quick` - 5-minute quick start
`/onboard:deep` - Exhaustive documentation

## Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze the Codebase

Scan the project to understand:

1. **Project Type & Stack**
   - Language(s) used
   - Framework(s)
   - Package manager
   - Build tools

2. **Entry Points**
   - Main file(s)
   - Configuration files
   - Scripts (package.json scripts, Makefile, etc.)

3. **Directory Structure**
   - Source code location
   - Tests location
   - Config location
   - Documentation

4. **Key Dependencies**
   - Core frameworks
   - Important libraries
   - Dev dependencies

### Step 2: Identify Key Files

Find and categorize the most important files:

| Category | Look For |
|----------|----------|
| Entry Points | main.*, index.*, app.*, server.* |
| Config | *.config.*, .env*, tsconfig, package.json |
| Routes/API | routes/, api/, controllers/ |
| Models/Data | models/, schemas/, types/, entities/ |
| Services | services/, lib/, utils/ |
| Components | components/, views/, pages/ |
| Tests | *.test.*, *.spec.*, __tests__/ |

### Step 3: Detect Patterns & Architecture

Identify:
- Architecture pattern (MVC, Clean Architecture, Microservices, etc.)
- State management approach
- Data flow patterns
- Authentication/authorization approach
- API design (REST, GraphQL, RPC)

### Step 4: Generate Onboarding Guide

Create `docs/onboarding/README.md` with:

```markdown
# [PROJECT_NAME] - Onboarding Guide

> Generated by Intelligent Onboarding Agent
> Last updated: [DATE]

## Code Tours Available

Run these for guided walkthroughs:
- `/tour auth` - Authentication flow
- `/tour api` - API structure
- `/tour data` - Data layer
[List available tours based on codebase]

---

## Getting Help

- Project documentation: [location]
- Ask Claude: `/explain [file or concept]`
- Team contacts: [if available]
```

### Step 5: Generate Code Tours

Based on the codebase, create tour definitions in `docs/onboarding/tours/`:

For each major feature/area, create a tour file:

```markdown
# Tour: [Area Name]

## Overview
[What this tour covers]

## Stops

### Stop 1: [Starting Point]
**File**: `path/to/file.ts`
**Lines**: 1-20

[Explanation of what this code does and why it matters]

### Stop 2: [Next Important File]
**File**: `path/to/next.ts`
**Lines**: 45-60

[Explanation continues...]

[Continue for 5-10 stops per tour]
```

### Step 6: Report Results

After generating:

```markdown
## Onboarding Guide Generated

Created the following:
- `docs/onboarding/README.md` - Main onboarding guide
- `docs/onboarding/tours/` - Code tour definitions

### Quick Stats
- **Files analyzed**: [X]
- **Key files identified**: [Y]
- **Tours generated**: [Z]
- **Estimated onboarding time**: [X minutes]

### Recommended First Steps
1. Read the Quick Start section
2. Run `/tour [most relevant area]`
3. Try `/explain` on any confusing files
```

## Integration with Other Capabilities

- **Knowledge Graph**: Uses graph data if available for better analysis
- **Learning Profile**: Adapts explanation depth to user experience level
- **Living Documentation**: Stores output in docs/onboarding/
